            What makes a supercomputer so super? Can it leap tall buildings in a
            single bound or protect the rights of the innocent? The truth is a
            bit more mundane. Supercomputers can process complex calculations
            very quickly. As it turns out, that's the secret behind computing
            power. It all comes down to how fast a machine can perform an
            operation. Everything a computer does breaks down into math. Your
            computer's processor interprets any command you execute as a series
            of math problems. Faster processors can handle more calculations per
            second than slower ones, and they're also better at handling really
            tough calculations. Within your computer's CPU is an electronic
            clock. The clock's job is to create a series of electrical pulses at
            regular intervals. This allows the computer to synchronize all its
            components and it determines the speed at which the computer can
            pull data from its memory and perform calculations. When you talk
            about how many gigahertz your processor has, you're really talking
            about clock speed. The number refers to how many electrical pulses
            your CPU sends out each second. A 3.2 gigahertz processor sends out
            around 3.2 billion pulses each second. While it's possible to push
            some processors to speeds faster than their advertised limits -- a
            process called overclocking -- eventually a clock will hit its limit
            and will go no faster. As of March 2010, the record for processing
            power goes to a Cray XT5 computer called Jaguar. The Jaguar
            supercomputer can process up to 2.3 quadrillion calculations per
            second [source: National Center for Computational Sciences].
            Computer performance can also be measured in floating-point
            operations per second, or flops. Current desktop computers have
            processors that can handle billions of floating-point operations per
            second, or gigaflops. Computers with multiple processors have an
            advantage over single-processor machines, because each processor
            core can handle a certain number of calculations per second.
            Multiple-core processors increase computing power while using less
            electricity [source: Intel] Even fast computers can take years to
            complete certain tasks. Finding two prime factors of a very large
            number is a difficult task for most computers. First, the computer
            must determine the factors of the large number. Then, the computer
            must determine if the factors are prime numbers. For incredibly
            large numbers, this is a laborious task. The calculations can take a
            computer many years to complete. Future computers may find such a
            task relatively simple. A working quantum computer of sufficient
            power could calculate factors in parallel and then provide the most
            likely answer in just a few moments. However, quantum computers have
            their own challenges and wouldn't be suitable for all computing
            tasks, but they could reshape the way we think of computing power.
